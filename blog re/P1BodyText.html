                what is Engine Develop now up to makeing a game in a console with only C# and the dotnet framework. <br>
                The developers have built the game engine themselves, <br> and will release their code when they finish making the game. <br>
                This is not a common occurrence in the video game industry. <br>
                It has happened before, <br> but not very often that small businesses build there own game engines in C# in all languages. <br>
                The developers are currently working on the project, <br> and have not released a release date but it will be published here in 2023. <br>
